# If you want to use special characters in this document, such as accented letters, you MUST save the file as UTF-8, not ANSI.
# If you receive an error when Multismarts loads, ensure that:
#   - No tabs are present: YAML only allows spaces.
#   - Indents are correct: YAML hierarchy is based entirely on indentation.
#   - You have "escaped" all apostrophes in your text: If you want to write "don't", for example, write "don''t" instead (note the doubled apostrophe).
#   - Text with symbols is enclosed in single or double quotation marks.
